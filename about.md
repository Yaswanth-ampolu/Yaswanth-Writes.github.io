- 📚 A knowledge repository for things I learn
- 💭 A platform to share my perspectives and experiences
- 🤝 A way to reflect and improve mysself.

## What I Write About

My writing covers a diverse range of topics, including but not limited to:

- **Technology & Programming** - ranting from my coding journey
- **Books,Games and Movie Reviews** rating games which i played recently, movies that i love to watch and books that i recomend you guya to watch
- **Productivity** - Tips that worked for me
- **Life Reflections** - Thoughts on everyday experiences and trauma dump



## Why "Yaswanth Writes"?

i have a bad habit getting bored or distracted  when i start any task and i keep forgetting what i wanted to start many times. so now i want to document myself and my journey going forward by ratting out myself. Years from now  i want me to come back here to feel great and see how i turned myself around and how i fixed myself and hopefully feel proud.This is Yaswanth-Writes for you
